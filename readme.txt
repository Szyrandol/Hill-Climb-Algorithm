Getting started with uploading some of my projects to github
Im not yet sure which files i should be putting in here so I'm just gonna do what folks on reddit suggested

this one is pretty straigthforward its a hill climb algorithm program written in C# that aims to find the x f(x) is the highest, where:
  a is the lower boundary of the period we're looking at
  b is the upper boundary
  d is precision
  T is the number of sets of Specimens (not really generations since theres no evolution i think families would bea good name)
